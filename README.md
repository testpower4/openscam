This project is inspired by Junseth's [interview with a social engineering hacker](https://www.tftc.io/junseth-exposes-bitcoin-social-engineering-scams/) , a minor that bought lambo with victim's money

We will provide offline pressure test for the safety of your digital asset.

## how

- We will tell you how you will be approached, say within the next month.
- You will get phishing messages.
- If you responded, we will agree to meet at a physical location, and you will see how the social engineering is carried at you
- If you didn't respond, we agree to meet at a location, so we do detections/hypothetical questionnaire together to ensure your asset has been:
-    - recovery plan tested
     - phrase/seed backup is safe
     - device safety
