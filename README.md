This project is inspired by Junseth's [interview with a social engineering hacker](https://www.tftc.io/junseth-exposes-bitcoin-social-engineering-scams/) , a minor that bought lambo with victim's money

We will provide offline pressure test for the safety of your digital asset.

## how

- We will tell you how you will be approached, say within the next month.
- You will get phishing messages.
- If you responded, we will agree to meet at a physical location (alternatively, a member of your family watching us through Zoom video scamming you alive), and you will see how the social engineering is carried at you
- If you didn't respond to the fake message (hopefully), we agree to meet at a location, then we do detections/hypothetical questionnaire together to ensure your asset has been:
     - CEX safety (like 2FA backup/recovery, KYC status noting)
     - recovery plan tested
     - phrase/seed backup is safe
     - device safety
     - the way you generating seed/private key reviewed
     - not using or have been exposed to wallets that had security leaks
       
- or, you can choose to receive/collect a packet, containing: 
    - witch attack model device
    - samples of easy seed keep mechanism
    - other attacking vectors
  
If you feel the pressure test is useful, some bitcoin donations will be appreciated!
